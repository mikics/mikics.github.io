Hi! My name is Michele Castriotta, and I'm a researcher 
in computational nanoplasmonics. I've just joined 
the Google Summer of Code 2022 as a contributor for the <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCS</a> project. 
I will work on implementing electromagnetic demos in FEniCSx. For more information, check 
the <code>gsoc-*</code> branches in <a href="https://github.com/mikics/dolfinx">my DOLFINx fork</a>.
