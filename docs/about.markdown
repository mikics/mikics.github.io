Hi! My name is Michele Castriotta, and I'm a researcher working on computational nanoplasmonics in [Dr. CiracÃ¬'s group](https://cbn.iit.it/web/computational-nanoplasmonics) at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. I've just joined the Google Summer of Code 2022 as a contributor for the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) project. I will work on implementing electromagnetic demos in FEniCSx. For more information, follow [my DOLFINx fork](https://github.com/mikics/dolfinx). Thanks for the visit! ðŸ˜ƒ
